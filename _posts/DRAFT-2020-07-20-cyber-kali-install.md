## VirtualBox Information

For all my Cyber Security work I use Kali as a VM within VirtualBox. There is a special VirtualBox image available from Offensive Security with some settings already pre-configured for you.

You can find information about the 2020.2 release of Kali [here.](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2020-2-release/). 

See **this guide** on how to set up Kali 2020.2 with VirtualBox.

You can download the VirtualBox specific image of Kali 2020.2 [here.](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/#1572305786534-030ce714-cc3b)
