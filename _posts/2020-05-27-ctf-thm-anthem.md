## Machine Information

![anthem](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-18-43.png)

Anthem is a beginner level room which requires you to answer eight questions, and find six flags. Skills required are basic knowledge of Windows and enumerating ports and services. Skills learned are the importance of examining source code, and manipulating NTFS permissions.

First start with a port scan:

Lots of open ports. This Nmap scan will provide the answer to Task 1, questions 2 and 3.

Reading [this](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en) article will help with the answers to Task 1, questions 4 and 5.

![robots](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-04-21.png)

The front page of the website gives you the domain for Task 1 question 6.

For Task 1 question 7 we are asked for the name of the administrator. Looking around we find this article:

![article](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-05-08.png)

Searching the Internet for words from the song gets you to a Wikipedia page that reveals the name we are looking for.

For Task 1 question 8 we are asked for the administrators email address. Reading the other article gives us the naming convention used for a different user:

![another_article](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-05-46.png)

We can easily work out what it will be based on the answer to question 7.

## Task 2 - Spot The Flags

Now we look for flags. The clue to their format is in the page where we enter them:

![tryhackme](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-06-10.png)

Answer format shows three characters then opening brace. We can use this to help search the source code.

First download the whole site:

```text
root@kali:~/thm/anthem# wget --recursive http://10.10.83.110
root@kali:~/thm/anthem# cd 10.10.83.110/
```

Now we can grep through all the files for our search string:

```text
root@kali:~/thm/anthem/10.10.83.110# grep -R 'THM' .
./authors/jane-doe/index.html:        <input type="text" name="term" placeholder="Search...<<HIDDEN>> />
./authors/jane-doe/index.html:                <p>Website: <a href="<<HIDDEN>>}</a>
./tags:        <input type="text" name="term" placeholder="Search...<<HIDDEN />
./categories:        <input type="text" name="term" placeholder="Search...<<HIDDEN>> />
```

All four flags for this task are easily distinguishable in the output.

## Task 3 - Final Stage

Time to connect to the machine to get the user and root flags.

Kali has rdesktop built in so can use that, some info on it [here](https://www.tecmint.com/rdesktop-connect-windows-desktop-from-linux/).

```text
root@kali:~/thm/anthem/10.10.83.110# rdesktop -u SG 10.10.83.110
Autoselecting keyboard map 'en-us' from locale
ATTENTION! The server uses and invalid security certificate which can not be trusted for
the following identified reasons(s);
 1. Certificate issuer is not trusted by this system.
     Issuer: CN=WIN-LU09299160F
Review the following certificate info before you trust it to be added as an exception.
If you do not trust the certificate the connection attempt will be aborted:
    Subject: CN=WIN-LU09299160F
     Issuer: CN=WIN-LU09299160F
 Valid From: Sat Apr  4 23:56:38 2020
         To: Sun Oct  4 23:56:38 2020
  Certificate fingerprints:
       sha1: d47d2a8f6143b820936e4120cdd19ddc5385d285

Do you trust this certificate (yes/no)? yes
```

Use password obtained earlier in r********s.txt file:

![win_login](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-06-35.png)

First flag is on the desktop:

![desktop](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-06-58.png)

Browse to C:, then change view settings to show hidden files/folders, reveals the backup folder:

![explorer](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-07-27.png)

Inside is the file restore.txt, SG hasn't got the rights to view it, but has got rights to change security:

![file_perms](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-07-49.png)

Add SG with read permissions, you can then open the file to reveal the password.

Now we have the administrator password, so we can open a new PowerShell window as administrator and enter the password we have just found. We can now navigate to the administrators desktop to find the root flag:

![powershell](/assets/images/2020-05-28-22-08-10.png)

All done. See you next time.
